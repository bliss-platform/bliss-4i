# Welcome to bliss

Source code for the fourth public iteration of the Bliss ecosystem.

Bliss 4i is a foundational release in the Bliss Platform roadmap.
This iteration introduces a stable, opinionated toolchain, a refined package management model, a predictable memory and execution model, and a formal specification for logging, CLI, and project/libraries structure.

Bliss 4i is the first iteration intended for real public usage, open-source contribution, ecosystem growth, and long-term maintainability.
